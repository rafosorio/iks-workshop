<h2>Before you begin</h2>
Before you begin, you need to have an IBM Cloud account. If you don't have, please get the IBM Cloud account type that is right for you:

<ul>
<li><b>Billable (Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription)</b>: No limitations. You can create a standard Kubernetes cluster. You can also provision IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) resources to create and use in standard clusters.</li>

<li><b>Lite</b>: You can create only a free Kubernetes cluster with 1 worker node to explore the capabilities. Later you will need to upgrade your account to a billable account if you want further capabilities.</li>
</ul>

You are able to complete the labs of the "How" section, using a Lite account. If you want to create a new Lite account, please follow the steps of the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/registration">IBM Cloud Registration page</a>.
