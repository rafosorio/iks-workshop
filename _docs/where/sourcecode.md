<h2>Download the Workshop Source Code</h2>
Repo <b>guestbook</b> has the application that we'll be deploying. While we're not going to build it we will use the deployment configuration files from that repo. Guestbook application has two versions v1 and v2 which we will use to demonstrate some rollout functionality later. All the configuration files we use are under the directory guestbook/v1.

Repo <b>kube101</b> contains the step by step instructions to run the workshop.
