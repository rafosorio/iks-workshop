`_2.` Open the <a href="https://login.workspace.ibm.com/" target="blank" >IBM Watson Workspace login page</a>.

`_3.` Login with your **IBMid** and **password**.

`_6.` You should see the “Choose Type” screen (if not, click on the “Choose Type” link on the bottom of the page). Here you should see your new “Opportunity Room” template. Click on “**Choose**” button, to create a space based in the Opportunity Room template.

`_7.` Enter “**Tutorial Opportunity**” (1) as the Space name, and you are welcome to define a cool **description** for your space (2). Enter an **"Opportunity ID"** (3), **"Contact count"** (4) and select a **"Deal Temperature"** (5). When completed, click “**Add People**” (6).

`_9.` On the “Review Apps” screen, you can review all the apps that will be added on your new space (as we defined in the template). Click “**Create**” to have your new space ready.
