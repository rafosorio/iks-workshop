<h2>Improve time to market with microservices</h2>
<p>Whether they're accessing a website or a mobile app, people have high expectations of the apps that they regularly use. As a result, companies must continuously deliver new features and fixes. In the past, this process was painful because an application was usually developed, built, and made available as a single, often monolithic, application.</p>

<p>Microservices is an application architectural style in which an application is composed of many discrete, network-connected components called microservices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Large monolithic applications are broken into small services</p></li>
<li><p>A single network-accessible service is the smallest deployable unit for a microservices application</p></li>
<li><p>Each service runs in its own process. This rule, sometimes stated as "one service per container," might be a container or any other lightweight deployment mechanism, such as a Cloud Foundry runtime</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Microservices Business benefits</h2>
<p>Businesses that adopt microservices enjoy many benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Efficient teams</b>
<p>Microservices are applications that are separated into a collection of small, independently deployable services. Because microservices are designed to act independently, they are naturally consistent with agile principles that promote end-to-end team ownership.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Simplified deployment</b>
<p>Each microservice is built and aligned around a business function to reduce the complexity of the application change-management process. Because each service is individually changed, tested, and deployed without affecting other services, time to market is accelerated.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Right tools for the job</b>
<p>Teams that develop microservices can make technology decisions that are right for the job. They can experiment with new technologies, libraries, languages, and frameworks, which yields faster innovation cycles.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Improved application quality</b>
<p>Because of the "divide-and-conquer" approach of microservices, both functional and performance testing are easier with microservices than they are with monolithic applications. Microservices architecture lends itself to test-driven development, as components can be tested in isolation and combined with a full or virtualized set of microservices. This approach results in overall improvement in application quality.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Scalability</b>
<p>Microservices are easier to scale than monolithic apps. Teams can more efficiently scale applications by scaling individual services according to their criticality to the overall app, throughput, memory, and CPU load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
