<p>With the Watson Work Services platform, you can build apps for Watson Workspace, or apps that stand on their own. Here are some of the things your apps will be able to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Send interactive messages into a space</p></li>
<li><p>Listen &amp; respond to events automatically via outbound webhooks</p></li>
<li><p>Allow users to initiate actions using conversational text</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also create apps that use cognitive capabilities to understand users' conversations and interactions. Your app can suggest actions, recognize sentiment, or provide expertise. And, your app can also be trained to understand business dialect associated with specific domains or industries. For example, a sales team uses different terminology than a medical team.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make it easy for users to catch up by summarizing the conversation with Moments
</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze and extract key information such as keywords, sentiment, dates, and more with Information Extraction annotations</p></li>
<li><p>Identify focuses (key phrases) within the conversation and suggest actions users can take inline with  Action Fulfillment</p></li>
</ul>
