IBM Watson Workspace comes with everything a user needs to do their best work. Users can connect and collaborate with their teams and other work groups from anywhere, on any device. It has full, searchable history and one central place for all shared images and resources. Users can connect third party apps to work more seamlessly with their every day tools and when conversations move fast, users can take advantage of our proprietary Moments feature, which summarizes hours', days', even weeks' worth of conversations down to meaningful highlights - extracting key topics, and actions, questions and decisions into a smart summary - so users can catch up in a matter of minutes. Plus, with built-in Zoom capabilities, the leader in modern video communications, users can connect face-to-face with anyone around the globe with a single click.
