How many times have you thought, I wish I didn't have to open another app to do X or Y? It would be so much easier to just click the action and take care of what needs to get done, for example, scheduling a meeting, looking up a company, or booking an Uber right in the conversation stream.

<p/>

Now imagine being able to do just that plus a little extra cognitive awesomeness with Watson. Say it ain't so? Well now it is!  Let's say you want to get information on a sales opportunity in your area for a product you are selling. You might say, "What are the opportunities for Product X?" The app can be smart enough to know there are several different packages for Product X and the answer is different depending on which offering you are asking about. In this case, apps can be designed to interact with you privately to clarify, Are you talking about A, B, or C? Voila! The information you were looking for is displayed and you never had to leave where you were working. You can share it back with everyone in the conversation.

These capabilities will be available in any app that is utilizing Watson Workspace Action Fulfillment API.

This lab will drive you to create a Watson Workspace Application with Action Fulfillment technique using Node.JS and IBM Cloud Platform.

Our app will be another type to send Inspirational Quotes/Messages. This app will understand when someone is looking for quotes or inspirational message. It is a really simple use case to see how to create a bot that use the Action Fulfillment API from Watson Workspace. Here you start to understand the difference of Watson Workspace and any other Persistent Chat (Watson Workspace is a messaging app with the built-in power of Watson - it's designed to help you and your teams do your best work).
