            <blockquote>
              <p>IBM has a Kubernetes-based container service for whatever kind of cloud environment your client wants to stand up: public, private or hybrid. It uses Kubernetes as a foundation to provide advanced capabilities for accelerating DevOps, modernizing traditional apps, and relieving the pain around security, scale and information management. As Kubernetes increasingly becomes the industry standard, your AppDev executive client has the ability to port Kubernetes-based containers into IBM Cloud, and take advantage of automated DevTest, CI/CD and 170+ PaaS services related to DevOps, data analytics, blockchain and Watson.</p>
